The experiment begins with an instructional screen instructing participants to initiate by 
pressing the space key, followed by an adaptation block featuring displays with a 2000ms duration 
and a variable white flash (950 to 1050ms) to reduce visual persistence. The adaptation display 
consists of 13 black dots with a 50px average size, varying individually within the virtual grid. 
Subsequent trial displays present small or large numerosity and mean size values in relation to 
reference values, with an Inter-Trial Interval (ITI) of 950ms to 1050ms and a white flash to 
diminish visual persistence. Variability in ITI aims to prevent observer habituation. 
Participants engage in Numerosity Comparison and Mean Size Estimation tasks across 72 trials, 
and advance to the next trial only upon making a selection.
