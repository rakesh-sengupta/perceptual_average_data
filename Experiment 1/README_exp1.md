The experiment begins with an instructional screen instructing participants to initiate by 
pressing the space key, followed by an adaptation block featuring displays with a 2000ms duration 
and a variable white flash (950 to 1050ms) to reduce visual persistence. The adaptation display 
consists of 13 black dots with a 50px average size, varying individually within the virtual grid. 
Subsequent trial displays present small or large numerosity and mean size values in relation to 
reference values, with an Inter-Trial Interval (ITI) of 950ms to 1050ms and a white flash to 
diminish visual persistence. Variability in ITI aims to prevent observer habituation. 
Participants engage in Numerosity Comparison and Mean Size Estimation tasks across 72 trials, 
and advance to the next trial only upon making a selection.

The CSV files for Experiment 1 follow a specific structure with the following column headings:

1. **Trial Number**: Sequential numbering of the trials conducted during Experiment 1.
2. **TrialTypeN1S2**: Indicates the type of trial. 'N1' represents numerosity trials, and 'S2' represents size trials.
3. **Nvalue**: Numerosity value of the set presented in the trial.
4. **Svalue**: Size value of the set presented in the trial.
5. **KeyPressZsmallMgreater**: Participant response indicating whether they perceived the test stimulus as having fewer objects or smaller mean size compared to the reference stimulus. 'Z' indicates fewer objects/smaller size, and 'M' indicates greater objects/larger size.
6. **ReactionTime**: Time taken by the participant to respond to the trial stimulus.
7. **Accuracy**: Indicates the accuracy of the participant's response, typically binary (correct/incorrect).

These headings provide insight into the structure of the data files and the information contained within each column.
