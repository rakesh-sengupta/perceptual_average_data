Experiment 2 began with participants reading instructions and initiating the session by pressing the space key. The adaption block, similar to the first experiment, marked the session's start. Each trial featured a 1000ms fixation cross, followed by a test stimulus presented for durations of 68ms, 500ms, and 1s. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and inter-trial interval (ITI) durations ranged from 950ms to 1050ms, maintaining variability to prevent observer habituation. After the test stimulus, a response screen prompted participants to determine if the stimulus had a larger or smaller magnitude than the reference (Reference Numerosity=13; Reference Average Size=50px), depending on the task, and to press the corresponding key.
