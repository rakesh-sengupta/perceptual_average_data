Experiment 2 began with participants reading instructions and initiating the session by pressing the space key. The adaption block, similar to the first experiment, marked the session's start. Each trial featured a 1000ms fixation cross, followed by a test stimulus presented for durations of 68ms, 500ms, and 1s. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) and inter-trial interval (ITI) durations ranged from 950ms to 1050ms, maintaining variability to prevent observer habituation. After the test stimulus, a response screen prompted participants to determine if the stimulus had a larger or smaller magnitude than the reference (Reference Numerosity=13; Reference Average Size=50px), depending on the task, and to press the corresponding key.

### Experiment 2 CSV File Structure

The CSV files for Experiment 2 adhere to a specific structure with the following column headings:

1. **Trial Number**: Sequential numbering of the trials conducted during Experiment 2.
2. **TrialTypeN1S2**: Indicates the type of trial. 'N1' represents numerosity trials, and 'S2' represents size trials.
3. **Nvalue**: Numerosity value of the set presented in the trial.
4. **Svalue**: Size value of the set presented in the trial.
5. **Time**: Duration of presentation of the test stimulus in milliseconds.
6. **KeyPressZsmallMgreater**: Participant response indicating whether they perceived the test stimulus as having fewer objects or smaller mean size compared to the reference stimulus. 'Z' indicates fewer objects/smaller size, and 'M' indicates greater objects/larger size.
7. **ReactionTime**: Time taken by the participant to respond to the trial stimulus.
8. **Accuracy**: Indicates the accuracy of the participant's response, typically binary (correct/incorrect).

These headings offer clarity on the content of each column in the Experiment 2 CSV files, facilitating easier interpretation and analysis of the data.
